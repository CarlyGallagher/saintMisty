        Saint Misty, is an up-and-coming synth-pop artist based in San Diego, 
        California. Her sugar-coated hooks explore her journey from growing up in a religious home and joining 
        a radical christian cult to finally breaking free to embrace her identity as a lesbian in a way that will have you 
        humming them all day long before you even start to unpack their layered meaning.

Drawing inspiration from punk and 70s/80s pop, Saint Misty blends catchy synths and clever lyrics to create a 
sound that feels simultaneously fresh and nostalgic. Her music aims to uplift and empower women and the LGBTQ+ communities that helped her find her purpose and identity.
The fandom surrounding her artistry is all about bringing the girls together, offering healing and authenticity to both her blossoming online community and every 
fan lucky enough to be in the room when she steps on stage.
