        Hey! I'm Saint Misty, an alternative R&B artist creating music that blends dreamy
        soundscapes with raw emotion. Based in LA, I'm all about that Y2K aesthetic and making
        art that feels authentic.

      <p style={{ fontSize: "13px", lineHeight: "1.6" }}>
        My music explores themes of self-discovery, heartbreak, and healing. When I'm not in the
        studio, you can find me vintage shopping, taking photos, or vibing to SZA and Frank Ocean.
